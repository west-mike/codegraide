# codegraide

codegraide is an early-stage Rust CLI for understanding source repositories through code-quality metrics, dependency graphs, change hotspots, and database ERDs.

The end goal is to give developers and automated agents enough measurable evidence to identify good and bad code, explain why, and find the code that deserves attention.

The project is currently being developed and is in its pre-alpha stage.

## Workspace

- `crates/cli`: command-line interface, presentation, and exit behavior
- `crates/core`: analysis domain, parsers, metrics, graphs, and reports

The project is in its initial foundation stage. User-facing behavior and contribution documentation will expand as the first repository-inventory milestone is implemented.

## Repository inventory

Inventory the current directory:

```sh
cargo run -p codegraide -- inventory .
```

The report counts inventoried files and separates them into source, documentation, configuration, data, assets, and uncategorized categories. Use `--list-files` to print the paths in one or more categories:

```sh
cargo run -p codegraide -- inventory . \
  --list-files source \
  --list-files uncategorized
```

Use `--list-files all` to print every category.

Repository `.gitignore` files are respected. To include selected ignored files, repeat `--include-ignored` with repository-relative globs:

```sh
cargo run -p codegraide -- inventory . \
  --include-ignored 'generated/**' \
  --include-ignored 'vendor/**/*.py'
```

Included files are combined with normal discovery results and counted once when patterns overlap. Built-in `.git`, `target`, and `__pycache__` exclusions cannot be overridden.

Ignored file and directory counts are reported separately. Ignored directories are not walked by default, so their contents are not included in the ignored file count. Use `--audit-ignored` when exact ignored paths and counts are needed:

```sh
cargo run -p codegraide -- inventory . --audit-ignored
```

## Category rules

Default category rules ship with codegraide. Additional JSON rulesets are loaded explicitly and may be layered:

```sh
cargo run -p codegraide -- inventory . \
  --config rules/company.json \
  --config rules/repository.json
```

A ruleset can classify files by extension, exact filename, or filename regex:

```json
{
  "config_version": "0.1.0",
  "inventory": {
    "ignore_defaults": false,
    "categories": {
      "source": {
        "include_extensions": ["go"],
        "include_filename_regexes": [".*\\.generated\\.rs"],
        "exclude_filename_regexes": ["^private/.*\\.generated\\.rs"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The supported categories are `source`, `documentation`, `configuration`, `data`, `assets`, and `uncategorized`.

Rules extend the defaults unless a category sets `"mode": "replace"`. Setting `"ignore_defaults": true` replaces all rules loaded before that file. Regexes containing `/` match repository-relative paths; other regexes match filenames in any directory.

Invalid configuration is an error. Nonfatal warnings explain valid but potentially surprising rule interactions. Use `--no-warnings` to suppress those warnings. Errors cannot be suppressed.
